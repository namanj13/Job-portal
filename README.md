## 🛠️ How It Works

**Client-Side (Frontend):** Developed with **React.js**, the frontend delivers a smooth, real-time interface for users to explore jobs, manage profiles, and submit applications.
**Server-Side (Backend):** The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, which handles API routing, user sessions, job CRUD operations, and form submissions.
**Data Storage (Database):** All user details, job postings, and application data are stored securely in a **MongoDB** database, with **Mongoose** used for object modeling and queries.
